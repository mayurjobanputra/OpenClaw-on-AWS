## 🤖 Let AI Help You Set This Up!

**This guide is designed to be AI-readable.** You can:

1. **Point any LLM at this guide** - Copy the contents of [`CLAWDBOT_AWS_SETUP.md`](CLAWDBOT_AWS_SETUP.md) into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, or any AI assistant and ask it to help you step-by-step.

2. **Use VS Code + Roo Code** - Open this repo in VS Code with [Roo Code](https://roo.ai/) extension. It can read the guide and **execute terminal commands for you** automatically.

3. **Use Claude with Computer Use** - Claude can SSH into your EC2 and configure everything hands-free.

The guide is written to be both human-readable AND machine-parseable with clear checkpoints and commands.

## 📖 Guide Structure

The setup guide has **two parts**:

| Part | What You Get | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Part 1: Core Setup** | Private Clawdbot server, secure SSH access, web chat | ~30-60 min |
| **Part 2: Digital Twin** | Email, GitHub, X accounts for autonomous AI | ~2-3 hours |

### Part 1 is all you need to start!

After Part 1, you can chat with Clawdbot via:
- ✅ SSH tunnel + built-in web chat
- ✅ CLI (`clawdbot chat` over SSH)
- ✅ VS Code + Roo Code extension
- ✅ Tailscale VPN (optional)

### Part 2 adds external communication

If you want Clawdbot to:
- 📧 Send/receive email
- 🐙 Push to GitHub repos
- 🐦 Post to X/Twitter
- 🌐 Maintain a public website

Then follow Part 2 to give Clawdbot its own identity.

### 🔐 Channel Security

| Channel | Security | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **SSH tunnel + Web chat** | ✅ Excellent | Only you have the PEM key |
| **Tailscale VPN** | ✅ Excellent | Encrypted mesh network |
| **X/Twitter DMs** | ✅ Good | Private, controlled account |
| **Email** | ✅ Good | Private inbox |
| **WhatsApp** | ⚠️ Risky | AI replies AS YOU — avoid |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/mayurjobanputra/AWS-Moltbot-Clawdbot.git
cd AWS-Moltbot-Clawdbot

# 2. Copy credentials template
cp credentials-template.md credentials.md

# 3. Follow the main guide

|-----------------|--------|
| Gateway bound to localhost | ✅ |
| SSH tunnel required for access | ✅ |
| Strong auth tokens | ✅ |
| No exposed ports (except SSH) | ✅ |
| Credential isolation | ✅ |

**⚠️ Never expose port 18789 to the internet!**

## 💰 Cost Estimate

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| EC2 t2.small | ~$17 |
| EBS 20GB | ~$2 |
| Elastic IP | Free (when attached) |
| **Total** | **~$19/month** |

With $1,000 AWS Activate credits: **~4+ years free!**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in the guide:

- **"Unknown model" errors** → Use `models.providers` config (not just `agents.defaults`)
- **"Missing auth" for Bedrock** → Create systemd drop-in file for AWS credentials
- **Gateway won't start** → Check config validation with `clawdbot doctor --fix`
- **Can't SSH** → Verify security group rules and PEM permissions

See the [Troubleshooting section](CLAWDBOT_AWS_SETUP.md#troubleshooting) in the main guide.

<summary>👤 Personal Project Notes (mayur.ai)</summary>

This repo was originally created for my personal AI assistant setup at mayur.ai:

**My Project Goals:**
1. ✅ Phase 1: Run Clawdbot on AWS VPS
2. ✅ Phase 2: Security lockdown
3. ⏳ Phase 3: Clawdbot identity (SES email + GitHub account)
4. ⏳ Phase 4: Public website on Vercel (separate from EC2)
5. ⏳ Phase 5: Crabwalk monitoring

**Architecture Decision:** Keep Clawdbot EC2 completely private. Public website hosted separately on Vercel. Clawdbot updates website via git push.
